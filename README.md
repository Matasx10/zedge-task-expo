# zedge-task

Used flashlist lib for efective multisized grid list. Good lib, gives control of lists and provides control.

Used expo-video for video. Just simply render video while in view so that memory is not eaten up.

Switch generated with AI, because did not had time to code from scratch.

Initiated project with expo. Removed unused files and added tailwind(config is empty i used inline sizings). Used redux toolkit, because im familiar with it.

Did not created env, because its just task.

Homepage and modal views by expo router logic.

Definitely could improve rendering of videos. Add thumbnails, find memory leaks, dig deeper with research how best solution would look like. Did not had a lot of time to do it 100% because of holidays and my current work I was limited in time. Had to buy gifts too.

Added commands into package.json to build localy android and ios apps. Ios requires dev acc to develop on device, i dont have that. And I dont have android so I used emulators to develop.

Design i only looked at overall look. Button and grid list. Did not add tags if they were needed. Just funcionality as now. Could have used component library for ready components, but Thought of doing from scratch and keep things minimal.

Overal list performace could be better i believe and videos could be rendered sooner, would need to do some architecture adjustments for logic and also do a bit more research or how to implement this/or even better look how pinterest does this or some other similar app.
